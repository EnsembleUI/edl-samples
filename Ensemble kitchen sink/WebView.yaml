                  WebView widget appears as WebView (embedded browser) on native apps while it appears as an iFrame on webapps. 
                  
                  **Note:** The events associated with the WebView such as onPageStart, onPageFinished and onNavigationRequest are only available on native iOS and native Android. They are not dispatched for WebView (iFrame) inside a webapp
